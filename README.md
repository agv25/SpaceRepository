The task was to model the Aerocapture of a Spacecraft around Venus in MATLAB.

The linear shooting method was used to calculate the boundary value problem given the required altitude at apoapsis and initial conditions.
ODEs of the forces in the x and y directions acting on the spacecraft were derived and then implemnented in MATLAB.
The Runge-Kutta 4 and initial value problem were combined to achieve the next x and y co-ordinate of the spacecraft at the next time step.
Modelled in 2D initally. 3D sphere model introduced later to further represent and visualise the aerocapture.
An additional computation to approximate the impulse required to at apoapsis to achieve a circular orbit based on the second phase of the Hohmann Transfer.
